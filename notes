Quarantine Bento ideas:
* when was the last time you ate here? DONE
* how many times did we eat there? DONE
* want to eat? DONE - from bucket list DONE
* overwrite record if same date DONE
* include price DONE
* accept $ in entry DONE
* word cloud with items DONE
* aggregate data from different chat rooms 
* bento where ?

* what should we eat today? 
  - given some keyword "咖哩" "魚" "麵" "壽司" - pick restaurant DONE
  - allow items to be more flexible DONE
  - randomize selection from restaurants pool
* 'Yesterday' or Day of week options instead of full date (relative dates)
* can you recommend something similar to this restaurant? - use some API?

* what did we eat on which day during quarantine
* how did you rate today’s meal?
