TODOs:

  - given some keyword "咖哩" "魚" "麵" "壽司" - pick restaurant DONE
  - allow items to be more flexible DONE
  - randomize selection from restaurants pool
* 'Yesterday' or Day of week options instead of full date (relative dates)
* can you recommend something similar to this restaurant? - use some API?

* what did we eat on which day during quarantine
* how did you rate today’s meal?

Table
